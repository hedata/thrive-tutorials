# tutorials
this repo contains the thrive tutorials
it is designed so you can take this to do all cleaning stuff and indexing stuff
and then import it into Meteor

# where
this will be deployed on lab.thrive.to and accessible for content generator staff

# configuration
the main index file is tutorial.csv
which should never be edited directly just by using notebooks

# General Workflow
  * 1 use INSERT NOTEBOOKNAME here to see which tutorials are not ready for import
  * 2 use the tutorial name and do all the checks we need (INSERT DESCRIPTION DOCUMENT)
  * 3 use INSERT NOTEBOOKNAME here to save your changes into the indexfile

Repeat from step 1

Sidenote:

if you are out of tutorials you can use INSERT NOTEBOOKNAME here to add urls for download
